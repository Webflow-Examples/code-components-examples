# Goal
Your goal for this project is to build and maintain separate folders of examples that show how to turn React components into Webflow code components. Each top-level folder should have its own self-contained project. To be compatible with Webflow Code Components, each component must have an associated `.webflow.tsx` file. This file is like a manifest file that describes how to translate React props for a given React component into a Webflow component props, which are similar.

- When creating webflow components, don't use dashes in the file name, just make it one long word (i.e., "accordioncontent.webflow.tsx" over "accordion-content.webflow.tsx")

- Do not use reserved JS keywords for the Webflow component files. For example, do not create a switch.webflow.tsx file, because that will break during compilation

- When making changes and you want to view it on Webflow designer using the Browser MCP, make sure to run `npx webflow library share` to update the component cache on webflow. Then stop running any tasks and ask me to confirm once the updated library is pulled into Webflow, as this is a manual step that requires human intervention

- Ensure that the dependency "@webflow/webflow-cli" is always installed in the package.json as a dev dependency before running the `npx webflow library share` command, and not a direct "dependency" in package.json
