# Webflow Code Component Examples

A collection of projects demonstrating how to bring code components built in React into Webflow via DevLink. Each example is a self-contained project that showcases different patterns and use cases for building interactive components that seamlessly integrate with Webflow. You can run a Devlink CLI command that will import the component into Webflow so you can try it on your Webflow sites.

## DevLink

DevLink is a tool to bridge Webflow and external code. This repo showcases how to create and bring your own custom, interactive React components directly in the Webflow canvas as Webflow Components via [Shared Libraries](https://webflow.com/updates/libraries).

Here are some reasons why you may want to import your custom React components into Webflow:

- **Custom functionality** beyond Webflow's built-in elements
- **Interactive UI** with complex state management
- **Data-driven components** whose bound props can be configured via the Webflow canvas or at runtime
- **Reusable components** can be shared across multiple Webflow sites

## üìÅ Available Examples

You can navigate into individual projects in this repo to copy, make tweaks, and import pre-made example components into Webflow.
